# coding-quiz

I am creating a timed coding quiz with the following parameters:
1. When a start button is clicked a timer starts and I am presented with a question
2. After answering, I am presented with another question.
3. If I answer a question incorrectly I lose time.
4. The game is over when all questions are answered or the time runs out.
5. When the game is over I can save my initials and score.
